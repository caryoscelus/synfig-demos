00:00.130 --> 00:03.210
this video is a short demonstration of "time patching" in synfig

00:03.310 --> 00:06.460
this experimental feature allows reusing objects in animation

00:06.520 --> 00:09.320
without interfering with their timelines 

00:09.480 --> 00:11.010
first, lets take a look at our character

00:11.130 --> 00:14.450
as you can see, it has several predefined poses

00:14.550 --> 00:17.590
for convenience i  placed them at whole seconds timings

00:17.760 --> 00:20.390
(otherwise, there will be a problem if we use different fps settings)

00:20.560 --> 00:25.260
now lets look at file that reuses the character

00:25.450 --> 00:29.390
at the start of timeline, those imported characters still have their old waypoints..

00:35.970 --> 00:39.120
this is our imported layer

00:39.170 --> 00:42.210
but it's imported as "time patch" layer, not mere "group" one

00:43.700 --> 00:47.930
lets jump to uncontaminated time position to see it in action

00:55.120 --> 00:58.660
here's where the magic happens

00:58.700 --> 01:03.380
the time patch parameter

01:03.380 --> 01:08.070
here it goes from 0s to 2s

01:08.410 --> 01:13.170
so if it would be a "free time" layer..

01:13.280 --> 01:16.990
.. you'd expect to see this 1s pose in between

01:17.800 --> 01:20.880
but when "time patch" is roughly 1s, we see nothing like that!

01:20.980 --> 01:24.310
we see a pose properly interpolated from 0s and 2s poses

01:26.810 --> 01:31.450
now lets play with time-patch waypoints

01:31.600 --> 01:36.260
and see the change of transient waypoints of the sub-canvas

01:36.350 --> 01:40.170
change interpolation type..

01:40.250 --> 01:45.110
..move waypoint..

01:52.870 --> 01:57.630
if we try to move transient waypoint however, we fail

02:01.250 --> 02:05.880
that's all for now
